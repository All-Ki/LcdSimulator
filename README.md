This is a simple application displaying numbers passed as arguments in an LCD-style fashion.

Usage :

Clone the repository then run

``` npm install ```

and then use it this way to print 100 :

``` npm start -- 100```

Please note that it only supports numbers, trying to print anything else will fail.
